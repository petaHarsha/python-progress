It’s been a bit hectic finding the right YouTube channel that covers all topics in a structured, engaging way. Most beginner tutorials felt dry or too slow, and I found myself losing interest quickly.

But today, I discovered a gem: Bro Code.

I watched about 1 hour and 47 minutes, and honestly — even though that might not sound like much — it was dense, valuable content with zero filler. Every line he said had weight, which meant I couldn’t just let it play in the background. I had to pause frequently, take notes, and recreate the exercises in VS Code.

For example, he built a numpad using a 2D array, and I stopped the video immediately to build it on my own. Most of my answers match his, but occasionally, his logic is more optimized — especially in terms of time complexity.

I’m realizing that watching tutorials actively (not passively) makes a huge difference. It’s not about how long you watch, but how deeply you engage.

✅ So yeah — Day X complete. Making progress one session at a time.
