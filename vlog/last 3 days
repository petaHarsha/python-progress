 i messed up man even though i am learning python ,i became confident that i  can go through dsa .i picked dsa 160 by geeksforgeeks then
first and second quiet easy then at third the dificulty begin ,i have to make sure that space complexity is o(1) which is though 
then i notecied there are videos, the logic i tried is quiet naive
