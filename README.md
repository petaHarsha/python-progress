Hi! ðŸ‘‹ I'm a junior Computer Science student from India. Over the past two years, I havenâ€™t done anything particularly noteworthy from my own perspectiveâ€”apart from a few capstone projects, which honestly felt more like routine assignments than passionate work.

This year, however, our college has given us dedicated time for internships. During this period, aside from completing NPTEL courses, Iâ€™ve decided to focus on actually programming, not just passively watching tutorials.

I really enjoy Python, and this repository is my space to:

Share my progress

Stay focused and disciplined

Document everything I build or learn

This marks a fresh start where I aim to code more, learn actively, and grow as a developer. 




you know what! chatgpt is the best make a amateur persepective look soo professional in my opinion
